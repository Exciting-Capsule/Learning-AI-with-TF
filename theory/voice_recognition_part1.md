Voice recognition have evolved throughout the year where more sophisticated level of deep learning applied to various data sampling for better accuracy. It is also a part of machine learning world where analysing the sample data recorded by the wavelength of a voice could be a part of data needed for analysis background.

In order to retrieve the voice sample data for analysis, having a basic voice recognition plugin which could stored wavelength of the voice input would be a good basic, For the plugin flow in TenserFlow.js, below are the basic needed for building voice recognition:

1. To be able to receive voice as an input.
2. To be able to store the wavelength in a number format.
3. To be able to replay the voice as an output.
